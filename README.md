# nyanspecialty

Nyan Specialty was founded in 2010 to be the trusted trading partner for specialty risk solutions and services to retail agents, brokers and insurance carriers. Our talent, innovation and execution are what continue to set Nyan Specialty apart from our competitors. These characteristics enable us to provide exceptional outcomes for our clients and have established Nyan Specialty as an industry leader.

Our culture of empowerment and teamwork provides our brokers and underwriters with the flexibility and agility to react to opportunities in the marketplace to best serve the needs of clients. Our team members adhere to the highest standards of the industry and are inspired by creativity, innovation and hard work. It is with these attributes that we have achieved excellent organic growth which is core to our strategy. This natural growth has been further developed through strategic bolt on acquisitions adding scale and differentiating skills towards achieving our goals.

I am very proud of what we have built in these few short years and want to thank the industry for its support. Without the collaboration of our clients and trading partners, we could not have achieved such significant growth and industry impact.
